# Image Filtering and Enhancement

This repository contains code for implementing basic image filtering and enhancement techniques using Python and OpenCV.

## Project Description

In this project, we explore fundamental image processing techniques for filtering and enhancing images. We implement various filters such as Gaussian blur, median filter, and bilateral filter to improve image quality. Additionally, we explore histogram equalization to enhance image contrast.

## Implemented Techniques

- **Gaussian Blur**: Applies a Gaussian kernel to the input image for image smoothing.
- **Median Filter**: Removes salt-and-pepper noise from the image using a median filter.
- **Bilateral Filter**: Preserves edges while reducing noise using a bilateral filter.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Improves image contrast by redistributing pixel intensities.

## Getting Started

Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Clone this repository to your local machine and explore the provided Python scripts for implementing different image filtering and enhancement techniques.

## Usage

Each Python script in the repository demonstrates the implementation of a specific image processing technique. Run the scripts using Python to see the results of the applied filters and enhancements.
